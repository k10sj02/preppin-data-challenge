# Preppin' Data 2021 Week 29

[Challenge description](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2021/07/2021-week-29-pd-x-wow-tokyo-2020.html)

What I learned/practiced this week:
* Practiced: date parsing
* Practiced: reshaping (melt, split)
* Practiced: string functions (lower, title, contains)
* Practiced: replacing text using a dictionary

NOTE: my solution is slightly different from the provided solution in that I converted all sports to Title case (for example, the provided solution has some sports listed as "football" and some as "Football," while I converted all of those records to "Football").
