## Charts

These chart outputs aren't pixel-perfect, but I wanted to try some new things without spending too much time tweaking them!

### Alteryx - chart workflow
The Interactive Chart tool has many useful features like batching (outputing multiple charts, grouped by a field) and transforming (splitting one input stream into multiple series on the chart). However, I've found this tool to be a bit buggy since I upgraded to 2020.3. I intended to batch (create separate charts) by Breakdown and transform (break into series/layers) by year, so I could format the years independently. That should work in theory, but in practice, my changes wouldn't stay when I entered them in the By Type tab (or the Individually tab) of the Layer configuration. ðŸ˜ž

Without the transform option, I could have crosstabbed the years into columns, and then manually added a layer for each year, so I could change the settings individually. In the end, I accomplished what I wanted by manually editing the colors and line widths in the tool XML.

### Alteryx - chart output

I did use an overlay tool to add the legend in the lower right corner, but for some reason it did not render in the png output.
