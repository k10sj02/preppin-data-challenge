# Preppin' Data 2021 Week 31

[Challenge description](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2021/08/2021-week-36-excelling-in-prep.html)

What I learned/practiced this week:
* Practiced: reshaping (pivot_table)
* Practiced: reversing a list

The tricky thing this week was (dynamically) reversing the order of the columns in the output. That was pretty easy in Python, but a bit more complicated with Alteryx. This is one of those times I wished the Dynamic Select tool allowed dynamic reordering of columns!
