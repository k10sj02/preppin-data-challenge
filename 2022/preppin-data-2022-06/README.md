# Preppin' Data 2022 Week 6

[Challenge description](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/02/2022-week-6-7-letter-scrabble-words.html)

What I learned/practiced this week:
* Practiced: working with decimals
* Practiced: parsing strings (extract)
* Practiced: resnaping (explode)
* Practiced: aggregation
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: the likelihood ranks in my solution do not match the provided solution. Some words that theoretically have the same % Chance were ranked differently in the solution due to floating point math. I used fixed decimals in both Python and Alteryx to get around this issue.
